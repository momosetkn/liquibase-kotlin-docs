[Liquibase-kotlin](https://github.com/momosetkn/liquibase-kotlin) was created with the aim of integrating [liquibase](https://github.com/liquibase/liquibase) with kotlin.
This product will perform migration using Kotlin to unify to the Kotlin language.
The purpose of this product is to provide integration with Kotlin-DSL, Kotlin Liquibase client, and integration with ORM.

The difference from the previous Kotlin DSL is that compiled Kotlin can be used.
I would like to recommend writing DSL in compiled Kotlin to take advantage of the assistance of an IDE and avoid runtime error.
